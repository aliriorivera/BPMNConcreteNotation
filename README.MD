# BPMNConcreteNotation
# Given a concrete notation for a simplified version of a BPMN process. I have made the metamodel (Domain Model Definition) of that BPMN concrete notation using the Ecore platform and I generated a small transformation from that simplified BPMN Metamodel to a bigger BPMN Metamodel.
# This is my version of a Model Driven Development.
